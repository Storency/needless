# Needless-JS ðŸ™ƒ

![Needless Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Needless-100%25-blue)

The JavaScript library you never asked for, never needed, and probably shouldn't use. But here we are!

## Introduction

Ever thought, "My project is running too efficiently, I wish there was a way to add some completely unnecessary code to it"? Look no further!

Introducing `needless-js`, the world's first and foremost pointless library. We bring the "Why?" into "Why is this even a thing?".

## Features

1. **Absolutely Useless**: Doesn't fix any problems because it doesn't know what problems are.
2. **Hilariously Redundant**: Why have one function when you can have ten doing the same thing?
3. **Zero Dependencies**: Mainly because no other library wants to be associated with us.
4. **Eco-friendly**: Uses 0% CPU because it does absolutely nothing.

## Installation

Why would you? But if you must:

```bash
npm install needless-js
``` 

## Usage

Here's a quick example:

```
import { doNothing, achieveNothing, pointlessLoop } from 'needless-js';

doNothing(); // Guess what this does?
achieveNothing(); // Still achieving nothing
pointlessLoop(); // Loops for no reason whatsoever
```


## FAQ
**Q**: What's the point of this library?
**A**: Exactly.

**Q**: Are there any updates planned?
**A**: We thought about it, but that seemed like too much effort for such a needless endeavor.

**Q**: I found a bug, where do I report it?
**A**: Congratulations on finding meaning in something so meaningless. But, no, we won't fix it.



## Contributions
Feel free to not contribute. But if you have too much time on your hands, sure, why not? Add more useless functions, or don't. We're not really bothered.
